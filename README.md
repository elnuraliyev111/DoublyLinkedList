# DoublyLinkedList

DOUBLY LINKED LISTS: PYTHON
Review
Congratulations, you have created a doubly linked list class in Python!

We did this by:

Using our Node class to hold the value and links between nodes
Implementing a DoublyLinkedList class to handle external operations on the list, like adding and removing nodes
Creating an instance of our list, and using the .stringify_list() method to track the changes we made
Instructions
Feel free to play around a bit with your code. Here are some ideas:

Create a few nodes and add them to both ends of a new doubly linked list
Remove your doubly linked list’s head or tail node
Print your list again — were the right nodes removed?
Remove a specific node from somewhere in the middle of the list, then print the list again. Did it work?
We created our .remove_by_value() method by iterating from the head of the list to the tail. Do you think you could start at the tail and iterate backward? Try it!
